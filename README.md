# dotfiles
Personal configuration for my favourite unix and unixy tools. 👨🏿‍💻 

This project uses [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) and a simple dotbot configuration (`install.conf.yaml`) to manage my dotfiles and keep them portable.

Run `./install` to sync the latest `dotbot` submodule and idempotently creates any dotfile links defined in the configuration.
